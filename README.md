# Knapsack-Problem
This C++ program is an investment optimization tool that uses the Unbounded Knapsack algorithm to help users maximize returns based on a fixed investment budget. It allows users to either load investment options from a file or enter them manually, specifying each companyâ€™s name, investment cost, and expected return.
